Simulation for Tohoku, Japan:
[from simulation /home/luoyd/qdyn_mm4]

1. Run JP_2d_s.m to compute 2D earthquake cycle simulations
   This simulation takes a few minutes or less
   It generates a M9.1 megathrust event every ~1000 years
   The output in matlab format is in the "JP_2D_s_*.mat" file
   A figure can be created by running the matlab script make_figures.m
   The output file warmup_jp.mat is needed for subsequent 3D simulations

2. Run JP_3d.m to compute 3D earthquake cycle simulations
   Beforehand, adjust the grid number nx (must be 2^n, a power of 2) and the warmup time (p.TMAX) accordingly
   It will store last step v and theta in warmup_jp_3d.mat
   Each time step in 3D takes less than 1 min
   Each megathrust cycle in 3D takes about 1000 steps
